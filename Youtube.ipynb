It all depends on the position and the people interviewing. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but are ones that I have personally been asked or I have heard have been asked from other colleagues and redditors.\\n\\nI hope these really do help you try to see what kind of questions you may be asked and what things you may need to prepare for to be ready for your next interview!\\n\\nLink to All Questions and Answers:\\nhttps://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/SQL-Code/blob/master/Interview%20Questions%20and%20Answers%20for%20Data%20Analysts.docx\\n\\n ____________________________________________ \\n\\nSUBSCRIBE!\\nDo you want to become a Data Analyst?

I am at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQQR60KtnFY&amp;t=506\">8:26</a> hr in the video and trying to complete Tableau full project. I loaded the XL file after combining all 3 CSVs into XL file. I pulled Zipcode into Columns and Price into Rows in Tableau working sheet, But it&#39;s not giving me Bar Graph visualization at all.... It&#39;s showing me only Map and Symbolic Map visualization and all other visualizations are blurred. What am I doing wrong ? What&#39;s missing ?<br><br>After spending some time, I guess, i understood the problem. Price is appearing as Dimension instead of Measure. How do we address such issues ? If I try to convert &quot;Price&quot; to  Measure from Dimension, Price gets automatically calculated as Count Distinct, it appears as CNTD(Price). How to handle such issues ? What should I do with the file that I am using for the exercise ?<br><br>I didn&#39;t even get the Map properly. <br><br>Can you help me here ?',\n",

Just one note: at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8FSP8XuFyk&amp;t=2100\">35:00</a>, it’s worth mentioning that relationships in Tableau are often significantly more performant and flexible than traditional joins. Relationships allow you to answer questions that would be difficult, if not impossible, to address with joins alone. For example, with a join, you might struggle to identify which job titles aren’t represented in your demographics or pinpoint demographics without corresponding job titles. Joins interface is very much goign to be the legacy approach vs the modern approach especially to get things working with semantic models and tableau pulse and other published data sources. <br><br>Using relationships can also reduce the number of connections needed, streamlining your data model. Kirk Munroe has an excellent, in-depth video (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2YgRYUMGYs\">https://youtu.be/Y2YgRYUMGYs?si=YEDIR4sXYl4s9qvG)</a> on the benefits of relationships, and it’s a common misconception that Tableau lacks this capability, especially in comparisons to Power BI.',\n",

I have a final technical interview in a few days and am so worried because I definitely feel confident to do the first level and mostly ok with second level (still somewhat struggle with subqueries) but definitely struggle with things beyond that. I’m so nervous and anxious about it. I didn’t really learn SQL anywhere formally just on the job as I’ve needed so I know there’s a lot that I don’t know.',\n",

However, I find this to be statistically important data. This is a proportion and gives a probability. For example, if you were to query &quot;SELECT stage, ROUND(AVG(percentage_laid_off),2)\\r<br>FROM layoffs_staging2\\r<br>GROUP BY stage\\r<br>ORDER BY 2 DESC;&quot; you would find the proportion of layoffs per company as opposed to just finding the companies that got rid of the most people. The argument here is that a large company with a layoff proportion of 0.05 could still show more people being laid off, then a smaller company with a layoff proportion of 0.7, even though this gives valuable insight that the past 3 years have hit small companies very hard. Thought I would mention this and open it up to any discussion.',\n",

       "  'Comment_Text': 'Wonderful video, Alex! I really enjoyed your explanation. I&#39;d like to suggest an alternative approach for removing duplicates that avoids making a copy of the copied table.<br><br>We can add a temporary id column to the layoffs_staging table using:<br><br>ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging ADD COLUMN temp_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY;<br><br>This adds a unique identifier to each row, allowing us to isolate duplicates. We can then use the following query to delete duplicates:<br><br>DELETE FROM layoffs_staging<br>WHERE temp_id IN (<br>SELECT <br>\\ttemp_id<br>FROM (<br>\\tSELECT<br>\\t\\ttemp_id,<br>\\t\\tROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions) AS row_num<br>\\tFROM layoffs_staging<br>\\t\\t) AS duplicates<br>WHERE row_num &gt; 1<br>);<br><br>ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging DROP COLUMN temp_id;<br><br>This approach avoids additional table copies, and ensures precise removal of duplicates. Thanks again for the fantastic content and putting all this effort on helping people!',\n",
